# MediRecord-Project-for-AlphaByte-Hackathon
 Healthcare is essential in daily life. Unfortunately, consultation with a doctor can be difficult to obtain, especially if we need advice on life threatening problems. The proposed idea is to create a system with Dialog Flow that can meet the patients requirements and also create an inventory for doctors to view,manage and cancel their appointments. Patients can see their bookings whether their appointment is approved or not. Notes-sharing system has been integrated which will send receipts, appointment confirmation in pdf format. It will improve the traditional infrastructure of the healthcare management system and give personalized recommendations. chatbot is built with medical applications having the potential to reduce healthcare cost and improves accessibility to medical knowledge by a simple chat through method. Chatbots are useful for patients and for those who want to learn more about health. Hence, people will have an idea about their health and have the right protection and prevention.

 Separate panels for doctor, patients and admins are kept for data protection and privacy. Abstraction principle is followed as patients will only be able to see the data of the doctors they have selected and can also go for second opinion.Sessions and authentication of passwords is checked and stored in database. POST method is used for data insertion and retrieval for security concerns. PDO (PHP Data Objects) is a database access layer that provides a fast and consistent interface for accessing and managing databases in PHP applications and is used for streamlining and fast performance.
